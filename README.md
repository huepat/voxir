# VoxIR: Voxel-Based Indoor Reconstruction

Dear colleagues,

Thank you for your interest in our work!

This repository will contain the code for the publication "Automatic Voxel-based 3D Indoor Reconstruction and Room Partitioning from Triangle Meshes".\
A link to the datasets published along with it will also be provided here.\
As the publication of the paper overlaps in time with my deadline for finishing my phd thesis, I am afraid that I am currently not able to do the necessary code cleanup and documentation.\
I assure that code, datasets and utility scripts will be provided until **end of August**.\

Thank you for your understanding.

Best regards

Patrick HÃ¼bner
(on behalf of the authors)
